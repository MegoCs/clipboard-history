# Search Functionality Demo

## Enhanced Search Capabilities

The clipboard manager now includes powerful search functionality with two search modes:

### 1. Fuzzy Search (Primary)
- **Intelligence**: Finds items even with typos, partial matches, or different word orders
- **Scoring**: Results are ranked by relevance with match scores displayed
- **Flexibility**: Great for quick searches when you remember parts of what you copied

**Example fuzzy searches:**
- Search "email" → finds "user@email.com", "Email Address", "my email is..."
- Search "hello" → finds "Hello World!", "helo there" (typo), "say hello"
- Search "pass" → finds "password123", "Password:", "pass the test"

### 2. Text Search (Fallback)
- **Precision**: Exact substring matching (case-insensitive)
- **Reliability**: When you need exact matches
- **Speed**: Fast for simple searches

### Interactive Search Interface

1. **Enter Search Mode**: Type 's' or 'search' from main menu
2. **Search Loop**: Stay in search mode for multiple queries
3. **Smart Results**: Shows up to 15 results with relevance scores
4. **Instant Copy**: Select numbered results to copy back to clipboard
5. **Help Available**: Type 'h' for search-specific help

### Key Features

✅ **Fuzzy matching** with relevance scoring  
✅ **Interactive search loop** - no need to restart search  
✅ **Instant clipboard copy** - select results by number  
✅ **Search help** - built-in guidance

                     ↓
             Enter search terms

```
